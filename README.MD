### Main Dashboard

* **Filters:** The entire report can be dynamically filtered by:

  * Year
  * City
  * Employee Name
  * Product Line

* **Top 5 & 5 Least Sold Products:** These horizontal bar charts quickly identify the highest and lowest revenue-generating products, respectively.

* **Count of Customers by City:** A map visual that illustrates the geographic distribution of the customer base across continents.

* **Total Revenue by Product Line:** A pie chart that breaks down the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.

  * **Classic Cars** are the most significant contributor at **41.19%**.

* **Sum of Sales by Order Year:** A column chart that displays sales performance from 2003 to 2005, with a notable peak in **2004** ($6.4M).

### Advanced Interactivity

**1. Report Page Tooltip** ðŸ’¡

To provide more context without cluttering the main view, a custom tooltip is implemented on the **Total Revenue by productLine** pie chart. When a user hovers over a slice of the pie (e.g., "Classic Cars"), a pop-up bar chart appears, showing the top-selling products within that specific category.

**2. Bookmarks for Detailed Analysis** ðŸ“–

The dashboard utilizes bookmarks to navigate to a secondary, more detailed page focused on product analysis. This allows users to seamlessly switch from a high-level overview to a granular examination.
